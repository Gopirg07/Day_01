1)HTTP 1.1:-
i)It works on the textual format.	                              
ii)There is a head of the line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources. 
iii)It uses the requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages	 
iv)It compresses the data by itself.	                                    
v)In HTTP 1 the actual data will communicate in a different way, it also has various other benefits like request prioritisation or multiplexing.

HTTP 2:-
i)IN HTTP 2 the works will be done by the binary protocol.
ii)It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiplerequests.
iii)The uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
iv)HTTP 2 uses HPACK for data compression.
v)In HTTP 2 a server can push resources to the client even without the client requesting them, just because it knows that the client will end up needing them.



2)Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:-
Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of primitive data-types as well as reference data-types. 
A JavaScript object has the internal properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable.
Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects.
